## Project Overview

The Pass Guard project leverages advanced technologies to present a robust alternative to physical cards often used in institutions. Its aim is to offer a more sustainable, easier-to-use option that eliminates the need for carrying around physical cards.

The system relies on face scanning technology for user verification, analyzing the user in real-time during every transaction and comparing this with the user's details already stored in the database. As an added layer of convenience and flexibility, the system supports QR code scanning for performing transactions within the institution, a viable alternative to NFC technology.

A unique feature of Pass Guard is its implementation of a blockchain-based solution, allowing users to transfer money both interpersonally and to in-house shops. These transactions are recorded on a secure, transparent, and decentralized ledger, ensuring the integrity and traceability of every transaction.

## System Functions

Upon successful user registration and administrative approval, the application initiates a face verification process during login. The user's real-time face snapshot is captured and compared to the faces stored in the database. If the verification is successful, a JWT token is generated and returned, granting access to a secure home screen. This screen displays the user's virtual card information, account balances, and recent actions.

For every transaction, the app triggers a face scan to confirm the user's identity, ensuring a high level of security. Depending on the user's phone capabilities, the system supports NFC or QR code functionality for performing transactions.

Simultaneously, administrators and security personnel can monitor all activity logs from the admin frontend, upholding system integrity and enabling prompt responses to any suspicious activities.

## Advantages

Pass Guard offers a comprehensive approach to transaction security, combining face verification, secure access to card information, and blockchain transactions. It introduces an improved user experience, facilitating secure transactions with a few taps on the user's device. Furthermore, the system's capabilities to handle transactions and operations within the institution make it a versatile solution for a variety of use cases.

## Conclusion

Pass Guard is an innovative step towards a more secure, convenient, and sustainable transaction experience, significantly reducing the need for physical cards. Its implementation of face verification, blockchain transactions, and real-time monitoring forms a robust system that serves as a standard for future secure transaction systems.
